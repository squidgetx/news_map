# 6-17

First milestone is automated launch of some kind.

- for later - db instead of fs
- we achieved the makefile making the whole map, yay
- i think the next step is to propagate this to the frontend for QOL - eg, with a 'latest' tag or something just for ease of development
- other things we have to do are figure out the correct number of clusters and map resolution.
- then, label placement / zoom ugh lol
- also refactor / move pre-processing somewhere earlier in the chain?
- then, frontend needs to know which maps are available and scrollability (well actually this is a pretty involved feature and requires date UI, etc. etc. might be better just have 'latest' for now?)

# 5-28

QOL improvements:

- makefile or script arg editing so you can easily run the whole pipeline for one set of args
- once topic2map has successfully run - how do you get it to S3?
- would be great to save the labels since they aren't super well adjusted

Must dos for preso:

- Rerun topic map for higher def map
- Figure out how to move labels around
- What is terrain color I forgot
- Upload live
