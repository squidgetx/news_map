QOL improvements:

- makefile or script arg editing so you can easily run the whole pipeline for one set of args
- once topic2map has successfully run - how do you get it to S3?
- would be great to save the labels since they aren't super well adjusted

Must dos for preso:

- Rerun topic map for higher def map
- Figure out how to move labels around
- What is terrain color I forgot
- Upload live
